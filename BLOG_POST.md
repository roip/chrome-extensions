# Focus Reader Bracket: A Reading Assistant for Dyslexia & ADHD

I've spent some time realizing an idea i've been carrying around for some years now, I never developed for chrome-extensions, and never particularly enjoyed javascript development, so it was always in the backburner, but with the advent of vibe coding it became a perfect candidate for experimentation. Introducing **Focus Reader**, a Chrome extension designed to help readers with dyslexia, ADHD, and other reading challenges maintain focus and comprehension while browsing. the code is in github if you want to contribute [here] (https://github.com/roip/chrome-extensions)  

## What is Focus Reader?

Focus Reader is a lightweight, Chrome extension that displays a customizable reading bracket overlay on any webpage. The bracket creates a focused reading area with adjustable shading and positioning, helping users concentrate on one paragraph at a time.

### Key Features

- **Adjustable Reading Bracket**: Position and resize the focus area to match your reading comfort zone
- **Customizable Shading**: Control the darkness and color of the surrounding shade to reduce visual distractions
- **Bracket Lines**: Optional visual guides on the left and right to frame your reading area
- **Auto-Detect Layout**: Automatically detect content width and adjust the bracket to fit the main article/paragraph area
- **move and adjust**: Click and drag the bracket to adjust its location and size on screen 
- **Settings Panel**: In-extension controls for theme color, bracket lines toggle, and settings reset
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Settings might persist across devices via Chrome sync (optional)

## Who Is It For?

- Anyone who finds full-page reading overwhelming and needs a focused, adjustable reading window


## Privacy & Security

this is a simple project 
- ✅ All functionality runs entirely on your device
- ✅ No data is sent to external servers
- ✅ Only your UI settings (positions, colors, toggles) are stored locally in Chrome sync
- ✅ No tracking, analytics, or third-party libraries
- ✅ No page content, browsing history, or personal data is collected

## How to Use

1. **Install** from the Chrome Web Store or download from github, 
2. **Click the extension icon** or set a keyboard shortcut to toggle the bracket on/off, i like ctrl+shift+f 
3. **Adjust** the bracket position and height:
   - Use the drag handles to move and resize manually
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for quick adjustments
   - Click the ⚙ icon to open settings and customize colors/toggles
4. **Auto-Detect** (optional): The extension can detect paragraph boundaries and auto-fit the bracket to content width
