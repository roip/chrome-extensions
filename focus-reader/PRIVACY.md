# Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 9, 2025

Focus Reader Bracket is designed to run fully on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

## Data We Access and Store
- **Overlay settings** (positions, sizes, colors, toggles, auto-detect flag, last detected bounds) are stored locally in `chrome.storage.sync` so your preferences persist across sessions/devices if you enable Chrome sync.
- **Page layout measurements** (paragraph positions) are processed in-memory to size the overlay. They are not stored or sent anywhere.
- We do not access or store page content, browsing history, user activity profiles, credentials, payment data, health data, or location data.

## Data Sharing
- We do not send data to any external servers.
- We do not share data with third parties.
- We do not use analytics or advertising libraries.

## Cookies and Tracking
- We do not set or read cookies.
- No tracking or fingerprinting is performed.

## Security
- All functionality runs locally in the page you activate. Settings are stored via Chrome-managed `chrome.storage.sync`.

## Your Controls
- You can reset all saved settings from the in-extension settings panel (Reset to Defaults) or by removing the extension, which deletes stored settings.

## Changes
- If this policy changes, updates will be committed to the repository and reflected in the extension listing.

## Contact
- For questions or requests, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
